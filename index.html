                <p>Hello! My name is Ding Jiahui. I am currently a third-year student majoring in Physics at the School of Physics, Shandong University. </p>

                <p>I am a member of the Shandong University Physics Innovation and Entrepreneurship Alliance. As a team leader, I have led team members to achieve awards in various competitions, including the National College Mathematics Modeling Contest (CMMC) and National College Mathematics Competition(CMC).</p>
                
                <p>My research interests lie in optical imaging. Additionally, driven by my long-standing interest in brain cognitive mechanisms since childhood, I would be delighted if my research work could be combined with this field, such as optical neural imaging technology, brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, and optogenetics.</p>

                        In early spring of my sophomore year, I joined the research group of Professor Ren Xiangxiang at the Frontier Physics Research Institute of Shandong University. Under the mentorship of a senior, I contributed to his bachelor's thesis on the polyphase filterbank (PFB), a digital signal processing algorithm that implements multi-channel filter decomposition and frequency band selection. I grasped the fundamental principle of this algorithm: decomposing the phases of sub-filters and then recovering the signal through FIR demodulation. However, when the project advanced to the hardware implementation stage, I realized my genuine interest lay in Fourier optics. Nevertheless, this experience significantly enhanced my ability to rapidly gather and filter information, particularly when entering unfamiliar fields. With my advisor's encouragement, I embarked on a journey pursuing my interest—turning vague concepts into clear and concrete actions.
